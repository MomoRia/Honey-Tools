# Honey-Tools
So, ya like honey? Yeah, me too. Only problem is its true only use is for honey blocks, usually used for Redstone.

Well, looks like that's going to change. To start, smelt Honey Comb to make Honey Ingots, which can be used to make some cool tools!

 

Have some suggestions? DM me at MomoRia#4240! This is my first ever addon so I hope you enjoy!

 

The Basics:

First you need to get some of that sticky, tasty honey comb! Put it in a furnace and throw it in there with some fuel to make a honey ingot!

You can also make Honey Ingot Blocks to help store all those delicious ingots!

The Honey Sword is maybe the most important part of the pack, you can craft it like you would with any other Sword but with the Honey Ingots

Installation: 

1: Install Forge at https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/ version 1.15+, any lower versions will not work with the mod

2: Navigate to your Forge installation and drag and drop the Honey_Tools.jar into the mods folder

3: Select the forge version of Minecraft in your launcher and you are goood to go!
